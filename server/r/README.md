# the `r` directory

This directory contains all routes of your application. In order to follow best practices of package naming ([details](https://blog.golang.org/package-names)), child directories usually consist of a short name plus a letter indicating the type of the route. For example, `sysh` for system handlers, `homep` for home page, etc.
